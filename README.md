# Arduino Code
This project is a combination of hardware and software. The Arduino board is programmed to automatically detect the people walking towards the dustbin to throw the trash. Once the sensor detects the person, the lid of the dustbin opens automatically, so that there is no need for the person to manually open the dustbin lid to throw the trash. Once the dustbin is full, the buzzer attached to the dustbin gives an alarm in addition to the LED light turning on, which indicates that the trash is full and the dustbin needs to be emptied.
